# chakra-ui-nextjs-example

In this example, I'm exploring the chakra-ui framework with Next.js

When I recently became aware of the Framework Chakra, I had to check it out. This example shows how the elements can be implemented in Nextjs and how they look and react. Wile developing this example, I was fascinated by Chakra and I'm happy to be able to release the first version now.

I also realize that I have to deal with it a little more. Especially the layout issue. This example was created quickly without testing it on other devices. Unfortunately, the documentation doesn't seem to be 100% correct either. Unfortunately, the first examples didn't work, but the error was quickly fixed with a Google search. Unfortunately, I did not document these errors - they are simply fixed in this project. In hindsight, I regret it somewhat. If I find time, or if I switch my project to this framework, should encounter these errors again, I will document them here.

If you want to know more about this framework is the first place to go [chakra project page](https://chakra-ui.com/)

The chakra template page is also interesting. I will also take a closer look at these to get a better feeling for this framework. [chakra-templates](https://chakra-templates.dev/).
